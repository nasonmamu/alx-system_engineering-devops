#Postmortem Report: Web Stack Outage Incident
#Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage lasted from May 10, 2024, starting at 8:00 AM EDT, until May 10, 2024, ending at 10:30 PM EDT.

Impact: Our main web application experienced complete downtime, affecting around 85% of our user base, who couldn't access the platform.

Root Cause:The outage occurred due to a misconfigured load balancer, causing uneven distribution of incoming traffic and overwhelming the servers, resulting in service downtime.

#Timeline:
2:00 PM EDT: Monitoring alerts indicated a spike in server response times, suggesting a potential issue.
8:05 PM EDT: Engineers were alerted and began investigating the reported anomalies.
8:10 PM EDT: Initial focus was on application servers and database clusters to identify performance bottlenecks.
8:30 PM EDT: Despite optimizations, the issue persisted, prompting deeper analysis.
9:00 PM EDT: Investigation revealed the misconfigured load balancer as the root cause, causing uneven traffic distribution.
9:15 PM EDT: The incident was escalated to the network infrastructure team for specialized assistance.
9:30 PM EDT: load balancer misconfiguration was confirmed and promptly rectified to restore balanced traffic distribution.
10:00 PM EDT: Traffic normalization was observed, indicating gradual service restoration.
10:30 PM EDT: Full service restoration was confirmed, marking the resolution of the incident.

#Root Cause and Resolution:
The misconfigured load balancer led to uneven traffic distribution, resulting in server overload and subsequent downtime. To resolve the issue, load balancer settings were adjusted to ensure equitable traffic distribution, restoring normal service operations.

#Corrective and preventative measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated load balancer configuration checks to ensure proper traffic distribution.
Enhance monitoring capabilities for proactive detection of load balancer anomalies.
Establish regular review procedures for critical network infrastructure configurations.

#Tasks to address the issue:
Conduct a comprehensive audit of all load balancer configurations, ensuring adherence to best practices.
Introduce redundant load balancers to mitigate single points of failure and provide failover capabilities.
Schedule routine training sessions for operations teams to enhance troubleshooting proficiency related to network infrastructure components.
